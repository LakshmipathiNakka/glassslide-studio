# PowerPoint-Style Slide Editor Features

## Implemented Features

### 1. Drag & Drop System
- Elements can be dragged anywhere within the slide canvas (960x540px)
- Smooth, fluid movement using GPU-accelerated transforms
- Elements cannot be dragged outside slide boundaries

### 2. Resize Controls
- 8 resize handles (4 corners + 4 edges)
- Real-time visual feedback during resize
- Maintain aspect ratio when holding Shift key
- Minimum size constraints to prevent invisible elements

### 3. Rotation
- Elements can be rotated using the rotation handle
- Smooth rotation with visual rotation line indicator
- Rotation state persisted in element data

### 4. Smart Snap Guidelines
- Horizontal and vertical alignment guides
- Snap to slide boundaries (edges and center)
- Element-to-element snapping
- Visual guidelines appear when elements align
- 5px snap threshold for precision

### 5. Visual Feedback
- Selected elements show blue bounding box with control handles
- Snap distance indicators appear during alignment
- Cursor changes contextually (move, resize directions)
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 6. Undo/Redo System
- Complete history stack (50 states)
- Cmd/Ctrl+Z to undo
- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z or Cmd/Ctrl+Y to redo
- History pushed after each drag/resize/rotate operation

### 7. Keyboard Controls
- Delete/Backspace to remove selected element
- Cmd/Ctrl+Z for undo
- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z or Cmd/Ctrl+Y for redo
- Click outside to deselect

### 8. State Management
- Zustand store for global state
- Element properties: position (x, y), size (width, height), rotation, zIndex
- Real-time updates to parent component
- Proper element layering with z-index

### 9. Performance Optimizations
- CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
- Throttled drag/resize events (0ms for maximum smoothness)
- RequestAnimationFrame for 60 FPS rendering
- Minimal re-renders using React refs

## Technical Stack

- **react-moveable**: Professional-grade transform library
- **zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **CSS transforms**: GPU-accelerated positioning and scaling
- **React hooks**: Optimized rendering and event handling

## User Experience

The editor provides a PowerPoint-like experience with:
- Instant visual feedback
- Predictable behavior
- No lag or jitter
- Professional snap alignment
- Intuitive controls

## Element Types Supported

- Text boxes
- Shapes (rectangles, circles)
- Charts (bar, line, pie)
- Images (placeholder ready)

All element types support the full transform system (drag, resize, rotate).
